        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>
            Mercy exists as an extension of the local Christian community and seeks to be an avenue of ministry for
            area churches. The vision for this ministry began to form in the fall of 1999 when God brought together a
            small group of individuals with a common desire to use medicine as a doorway to minister the needs of the
            low-income uninsured in Athens, Georgia. For two years, this small group continued to pray about their
            vision, and as they did so, their group expanded.</p>
        <p>
            On September 10, 2001, Mercy opened with a prayer, and volunteers began to care for the medical, emotional,
            spiritual, and pharmacy needs of the patients who arrived. Sunday school classrooms at Redeemer
            Presbyterian Church served as makeshift exam rooms and an office became the pharmacy.
            Our patient volume has continued to grow, and in July of 2007, Mercy Health Center moved to its own
            facility. We have medical clinics scheduled throughout the week during regular administrative hours, and
            Tuesday-Thursday evenings. We also have pharmacy refill clinic on Wednesday mornings and Tuesday,
            Wednesday, and Thursday evenings. Dental clinics are held on Fridays. In 2015, 10,479 patient visits were
            provided.
