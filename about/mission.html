        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>“Through a community of volunteers, Mercy provides quality, whole-person healthcare in a Christ-centered
            environment to our underserved neighbors.”</p>

        <p>In his time on Earth, Jesus Christ validated the dignity of human beings by taking on human form and
            concerning himself with feeding, clothing, and healing the people around him, especially those without
            economic or social resources. In our time, God has given us the talents and resources to minister
            specifically to physical needs. In caring for the body, we seek opportunities to minister to the eternally
            important spiritual needs of individuals.</p>
