        Once confirmed, your donation is an unconditional and voluntary gift to Mercy Health Center. Generally, charities do not refund donations due to the difficulties with tax receipting. Therefore, Mercy Health Center does not issue refunds to donors for tax-deductible contributions it processes. Exceptions can be made under extenuating circumstances including, but not limited to, a system processing error or human error (for example, extra zeros, duplicate amounts, etc.). If you experience an error, please contact us immediately using the contact information below.
