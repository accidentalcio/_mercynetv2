          <ul>
            <li>Administrative Assistance</li>
              <li>Medical, Pharmacy and Dental Care</li>
             <li> Emotional and Spiritual Care</li>
             <li> Fundraising and Marketing</li>
             <li> Building Maintenance</li> 
      </ul>
            <br />
    
        <p>All support volunteer positions are currently full.  Applications will open back up starting in the new year.</p>
