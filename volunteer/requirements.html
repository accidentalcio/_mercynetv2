        <h3>Patient Support Volunteer</h3>
        <p>Mercy Health Center is volunteer-supported. You do not have to be a healthcare professional to join us in this effort. We have many volunteer opportunities that extend beyond those of providing patient care during clinic hours. Currently, our volunteers serve in these and other areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Administrative Assistance</li>
              <li>Medical, Pharmacy & Dental Care</li>
             <li> Emotional & Spiritual Care</li>
             <li> Fundraising & Marketing</li>
             <li> Building Maintenance</li> <br />
    
        <p>All non-professionals interested in volunteering, must fill out a completed <a href="/images/Patient-Support-Volunteer-Application-18.pdf" download> Patient Support Volunteer Application </a> and email it to <a href="mailto:volunteer@mercyhealthcenter.net">volunteer@mercyhealthcenter.net</a> and our volunteer coordinator will contact you. Our volunteer coordinator will not be reviewing these applications until <b>March 2019</b> due to the high volume of applications already received.</p>
     
        <p>If you are interested in volunteering as a <b>MD, DMD, PA, NP, PharmD, PHD, RN, or LCSW</b>, etc., please see the <a href="https://www.mercyhealthcenter.net/clinicalvolunteers">Clinical Volunteers</a> page.</p>
