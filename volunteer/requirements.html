          <ul>
            <li>Administrative Assistance</li>
              <li>Medical, Pharmacy and Dental Care</li>
             <li> Emotional and Spiritual Care</li>
             <li> Fundraising and Marketing</li>
             <li> Building Maintenance</li> 
      </ul>
            <br />

Our volunteer coordinator will not be reviewing these applications until <b>March 2019</b> due to the high volume of applications already received. Please continue to check back to see when we are accepting/reviewing new volunteer applications!</p>
