        <h3>Clinical Volunteer</h3>
        <p>Though Mercy has some full-time clinical staff, volunteer professionals support a majority of the medical services offered at Mercy.</p>
        <p>Clinical volunteers are those who are credentialed as MD, DMD, PA, NP, PharmD, PHD, RN, or LCSW, etc. If you are interested in volunteering as a healthcare professional, send your completed <a href="/images/Clinical-Volunteer-Application-18.pdf" download> Clinical Volunteer Application </a> to <a href=mailto:volunteer@mercyhealthcenter.net> volunteer@mercyhealthcenter.net </a> and our volunteer coordinator will contact you. If you are interested in volunteering at Mercy but are not credentialed, please see our <a href="https://www.mercyhealthcenter.net/patientsupportvolunteer">patient support volunteer page.</a> </p>
