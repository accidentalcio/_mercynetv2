            <p>The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? 17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.<br />-- 1 Corinthians 10:16-17</p>

              <h2>Get Involved at Mercy</h2>
      <h3>Pray</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, we ask that you pray for Mercy Health Center and its continued growth and development. The needs are great, and the opportunities for service are endless. In the face of these many needs, we want to remain true to God’s will for this ministry.</p>

      <h3>Meals for Mercy</h3>

        <p>On nights with extended clinic hours, many volunteers come straight from school or work to serve Mercy’s patients. One way to be a part of the work at Mercy is to help provide a meal on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday evening (5:30pm) for approximately 35 volunteers. We strongly believe that happy volunteers, who are not hungry, make happy patients! If you are interested in feeding volunteers, please contact Angie Johnson by phone: 706-425-9445 ext. 202 or by email at: <a href="mailto:angie@mercyhealthcenter.net"> angie@mercyhealthcenter.net.</a></p>
