											<h3>Whole Person Care</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In his time on Earth, Jesus Christ validated the dignity of human beings by taking on human form and concerning himself with feeding, clothing, and healing the people around him, especially those without economic or social resources. In our time, God has given us the talents and resources to minister specifically to physical needs. In caring for the body, we seek opportunities to minister to the eternally important spiritual needs of individuals.</p>

											<h3>Christ Centered</h3>
										</header>
										<p>We believe that in Jesus Christ the love, mercy and grace of God are made known to us and to all people. We seek to follow him – in his identification with and compassion for the poor, the afflicted, and the marginalized; in his desire for the physical, emotional, and spiritual wholeness of each individual; in his call to share our resources and talents with each other. We look to the Lord as the ultimate author, leader, and guide of all we undertake. Our purpose, vision, ministries, and decisions are nurtured in prayer, seeking the direction and wisdom of the Lord.</p>

								<h2>Motivated by love for one another</h2>
								<p>We take seriously God’s command to love one another. From the overflowing abundance of God’s love we find our motivation and ability to serve others. We strive to develop caring, supportive relationships with our patients, volunteers, staff, supporters, churches and community partners. We follow the model Jesus provided through his love for all people without discrimination or conditions; in his example of servanthood; and in his offer of new life through faith in him. Through our belief and practice, we bear witness to the redemption offered through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
