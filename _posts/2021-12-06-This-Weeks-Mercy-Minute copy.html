<h3>Meet our Volunteers - Matthew Lynch</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/12062021/mlynch.jpg" style="width:35%"/>

<p>Matthew said he decided to volunteer at Mercy because he was looking for a way to combine his interests in Healthcare and serving vulnerable populations, and a friend told him about Mercy Health Center. During his two and a half years he has volunteered at Mercy, he has served on the prayer team, the eligibility team, and as a clinic manager. His favorite part has been encouraging patients and volunteers to make the most of their situation and see God's hand in the little things. </p>

<p>We are so grateful for your commitment to our mission and for all you do for our patients, Matthew!</p>

<p>Invite your friends for the 4th Annual Milledge Mile presented by Athens Road Runners and run down the best street in Athens. Anyone can run a mile. Itâ€™s shorter than a 5k and open to all ability levels. Plus there is a virtual option so you can run it anywhere. Mercy Health Center is the 2021 beneficiary of the Milledge Mile. All net proceeds from the race will be donated to Mercy's mission.</p>
