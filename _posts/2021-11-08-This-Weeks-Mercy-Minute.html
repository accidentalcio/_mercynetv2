<h2>Mercy Gives Thanks!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/11082021/mthanksyou.png" style="width:50%"/>
<p>As we welcome in the month of November, we wanted to take a moment to thank you for your generosity and prayers! You have helped Mercy Health Center provide hope and Christ-centered love through high quality, whole person care for almost 6,000 patients in Athens-Clarke County and five contiguous counties in 2021. Our Mission wouldn't be possible without your continued support! </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3>Meet the Team - Teresa Carson</h3>

<p>Teresa Carson currently volunteers as a Spanish interpreter here at Mercy Health Center. She studied Romance Languages and Linguistics at the University of Georgia. She also continued learning and practicing speaking Spanish as she traveled through Spain and Central America. She is passionate about working with migrants and refugees and helping to teach them new things. Teresa says her favorite part  about Mercy is the environment/culture and how Mercy opens with praying over our staff and patients every morning. </p>

<p>Cynthia says “Mercy has been a grounding place for me and very instrumental in getting me acclimated to the Athens area. It feels like home.”</p>
<p>She appreciates Mercy’s commitment to the Spanish speaking community and when not serving at Mercy, she enjoys traveling with her family, cooking, and gardening.</p>

It’s shorter than a 5k and open to all ability levels. Plus there is a virtual option so you can run it anywhere. Mercy Health Center is the 2021 beneficiary of the Milledge Mile.
