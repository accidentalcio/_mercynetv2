<h2>Have You Ever Heard of MMAP?</h2>
<p>MMAP stands for Mercy Medication Assitance Program. At Mercy Health Center, medications that are too expensive to be purchased at outside pharmacies such as insulin and inhalers can often be ordered through the MMAP program. Our MMAP coordinator meets with patients to order their medications directly from the pharmaceutical companies. Mandy Baxley, our MMAP coordinator, orders over 100 medications a month providing much needed, life saving prescriptions.</p>
