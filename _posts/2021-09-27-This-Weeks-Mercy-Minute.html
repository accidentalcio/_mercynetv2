<p>Thank you to everyone who donated to Mercy’s 20th Anniversary Campaign! It is because of your generosity that we will soon be able to provide in house lab services for our patients. We have raised close to $30,000 out of our $40,000 goal. We want you to know it is not too late to donate! Remember, all donations made through the end of the month, will be matched by an anonymous donor up to $15,000. Again, we appreciate your generosity and continued support of Mercy Health Center. You can click the link below to donate, or you can donate through our new Venmo account. </p>

<p>We greatly appreciate your gifts and prayers!</p>
