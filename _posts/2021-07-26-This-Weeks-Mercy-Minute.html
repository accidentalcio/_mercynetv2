<h2>Volunteer Spotlight!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/07262021/madison.jpg" style="width:35%"/>
<p>Last week we celebrated and thanked Madison because July 20th was her last day at Mercy! She is one of the most committed volunteers Mercy has ever had, and we are so grateful for her willingness to serve. Madison has been contributing to Mercy's mission for the past four and a half years and has logged 1044 hours as a triage volunteer. We are sad to see her go but wish her the best of luck at medical school!</p>

<h2>Milledge Mile!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/07122021/mmile.jpg" style="width:35%"/>
<p>Invite your friends for the 4th Annual Milledge Mile presented by Athens Road Runners and run down the best street in Athens. Anyone can run a mile. It’s shorter than a 5k and open to all ability levels. Plus there is a virtual option so you can run it anywhere. Mercy Health Center is the 2021 beneficiary of the Milledge Mile. All net proceeds from the race will be donated to Mercy's mission.</p>
