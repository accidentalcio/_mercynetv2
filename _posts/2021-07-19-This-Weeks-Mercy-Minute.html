<h2>Milledge Mile!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/07122021/mmile.jpg" style="width:35%"/>
<p>Invite your friends for the 4th Annual Milledge Mile presented by Athens Road Runners and run down the best street in Athens. Anyone can run a mile. It’s shorter than a 5k and open to all ability levels. Plus there is a virtual option so you can run it anywhere. Mercy Health Center is the 2021 beneficiary of the Milledge Mile. All net proceeds from the race will be donated to Mercy's mission.</p>

<h2>Meet the Team Monday!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/07192021/jordan.png" style="width:35%"/>
<p>Jordan is an Athens native and comes from a medical family. He is going into his second year of pharmacy school and is working as the pharmacy tech at Mercy this summer. Jordan has been at Mercy since 2018 and has volunteered in the pharmacy and later went on to manage the clinic. Jordan’s love for pharmacy derived from his mother, Missy, the pharmacy director at Mercy Health Center, and we are so grateful for his contribution to Mercy’s mission this summer!!</p>
