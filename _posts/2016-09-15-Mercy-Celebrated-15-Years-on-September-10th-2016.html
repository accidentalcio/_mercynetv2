Mercy has grown substantially thanks to faithful donors and thanks to over 700 volunteers who support our mission. This past weekend Mercy celebrated its 15th birthday. Happy birthday Mercy! We look forward to our future as we strive to provide quality, whole-person care in a Christ-Centered environment.</p>
