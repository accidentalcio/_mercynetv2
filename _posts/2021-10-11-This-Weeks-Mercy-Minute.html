<h3>Did You Know Mercy Provides . . .</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/10112021/provides.jpg" style="width:35%"/>

<p>Insulin!</p>
<p>This insulin delivery was made possible by our Mercy Medication Assistance Program Coordinator, Mandy Baxley and our Pharmacists, Susie Liu, Missy Sennowitz, Rebecca Stone, and Blake Johnson.</p>
<p>Insulin is a life saving drug that our diabetic patients need to survive. Over the past 15 years, insulin prices have almost tripled making it difficult for diabetics to afford their insulin. We proudly shepard our patients through the process of ordering their medications directly from the pharmaceutical companies, making it more affordable for them! We couldn’t do it without our dedicated pharmaceutical staff! </p>


<h2>Mercy Volunteer Spotlight</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/10112021/mcconnel.jpg" style="width:40%"/>
<p>Meet our incredible volunteer, Cynthia McConnel! Cynthia has volunteered at Mercy since 2013, logging over 1,000 hours. She is a retired RN, but volunteers as an interpreter at Mercy. She has lived in Texas, Spain, New Mexico, and Augusta, working at the Medical College of Georgia, while living in Augusta.l </p>
<p>Cynthia says “Mercy has been a grounding place for me and very instrumental in getting me acclimated to the Athens area. It feels like home.”</p>
<p>She appreciates Mercy’s commitment to the Spanish speaking community and when not serving at Mercy, she enjoys traveling with her family, cooking, and gardening.</p>
<p>We are so thankful for her commitment to Mercy and for all the hard work she does for our Spanish speaking patients!</p>
