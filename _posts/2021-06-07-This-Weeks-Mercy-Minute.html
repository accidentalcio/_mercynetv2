<h2>Dental Clinic Reopening</h2>
<p>Mercy's dental clinic will be reopening on Wednesday, June 9th. We are excited to announce Dr. Alec Hall as a volunteer dentist who is leading our clinic. Alec recently graduated from dental school, and while he was pre-dental at the University of Georgia, he shadowed Dr. Satterfield at Mercy. We are grateful for Alec's willingness to serve our community, and we are excited to see how Mercy continues to help train the next generation of providers.</p>
<p>We are in need of more volunteer dentists. Please contact Mercy if you would be interested in serving in this capacity.</p>
