<p>A very special lady at Mercy Health Center, Gale initially came to Mercy as a patient. Over the years she has worked as a volunteer at Mercy and has been the office manager for over four years. She graduated from Auburn University and the University of Memphis and has spent most of her life working as a health services researcher and college sociology instructor. Gale is the epitome of Mercy’s mission, and we could not be more thankful to have her on our team!!</p>
