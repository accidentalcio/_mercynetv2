<h2>Mercy Gives Thanks!</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/11222021/coach.png" style="width:75%"/>
<p>We wanted to thank everyone who signed up for our Open House event last Wednesday and for all of those who came out and attended! Our staff members and volunteers were proud to show everyone the 'Heart and Soul' of Mercy. We look forward to hosting more tours of Mercy in the upcoming year!  </p>



<h3>Meet the Team</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/11222021/mteam.jpg" style="width:35%"/>

<p>This week we wanted to shout out our amazing Pharmacy Staff, MMAPP Coordinator, and Volunteer Coordinator!</p>

<p>Our Pharmacy staff Includes Susie Liu, Angela Miller, Missy Sennowitz, and Tracy Trigleth. These ladies work hard to make sure our patients prescriptions are filled Monday through Friday!</p>

<p>Our MMAP Coordinator is Mandy Baxley. Mandy works with our patients who need more expensive medications like insulin and inhalers. She meets with patients and helps to guide them through the process of receiving their medications directly from pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Our Volunteer Coordinator is Stephanie Woelfl. Stephanie works with our many student, physician, and individual volunteers who want to spend their generous time at Mercy.</p>

<p>We are so thankful for these amazing staff members and all of the hard work they do for Mercy!</p>

<h2>Mercy Volunteer Spotlight</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/mminute/10112021/mcconnel.jpg" style="width:40%"/>
<p>Meet our incredible volunteer, Cynthia McConnel! Cynthia has volunteered at Mercy since 2013, logging over 1,000 hours. She is a retired RN, but volunteers as an interpreter at Mercy. She has lived in Texas, Spain, New Mexico, and Augusta, working at the Medical College of Georgia, while living in Augusta.l </p>
<p>Cynthia says “Mercy has been a grounding place for me and very instrumental in getting me acclimated to the Athens area. It feels like home.”</p>
<p>She appreciates Mercy’s commitment to the Spanish speaking community and when not serving at Mercy, she enjoys traveling with her family, cooking, and gardening.</p>
<p>We are so thankful for her commitment to Mercy and for all the hard work she does for our Spanish speaking patients!</p>

It’s shorter than a 5k and open to all ability levels. Plus there is a virtual option so you can run it anywhere. Mercy Health Center is the 2021 beneficiary of the Milledge Mile. All net proceeds from the race will be donated to Mercy's mission.</p>
