          <h3>What is Wellness?</h3>
            <p>Wellness is important for improving and maintaining a higher quality of health. Health goes beyond being free from an illness or disease. Your health is a result of your physical, mental, and social-wellbeing. <br />
Mercyâ€™s Health and Wellness unit promotes holistic care by offering services aimed at improving patient wellness and health literacy. Services offered include smoking cessation classes, diabetes education courses, Building Healthy Habits classes, nutrition appointments, health coaching, Food eTalk and more.<br />

              Our services work to improve <b>health literacy</b> among patients. Being able to understand healthcare information and instructions is important for making and maintaining positive health decisions.</p>
