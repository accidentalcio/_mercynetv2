          <h3>What is Wellness?</h3>
            <p>Health and wellness go hand in hand, as wellness is important for improving and maintaining a higher quality of health. Health is more than being free from a disease or illness. Your health is a combination of your physical, mental, and social well-being.</p>
          
          <h3>How can we help you?</h3>
              
<p>To improve patient health and wellness, we meet patients in their current state of well-being and work to change or improve behaviors. We help bridge patient engagement with provider recommendations by assisting patients in setting goals focused on improving awareness, motivation, and confidence with choices of health behaviors.</p>

<p>Through health and wellness, we promote holistic care by offering services aimed at improving patient wellness and health literacy. Services offered include smoking cessation classes, diabetes education courses, Building Healthy Habits classes, nutrition appointments, health coaching, Food eTalk, and more.</p>
