      <p><a href="https://www.goodrx.com/">GoodRx.com</a> <br />

      <h3>Mercy Medication Assistance Program (MMAP)</h3>
       <p>Medications that are too expensive to be purchased at outside pharmacies such as insulin and inhalers can often be ordered through the MMAP program. Our MMAP Coordinator meets with patients to order their medications directly from the pharmaceutical companies. The cost is only $10 per 3 month supply of medication (up to $30 each order). Just check with the pharmacy or your doctor to see if the medication you have been prescribed could be ordered through MMAP! <br /></p>
<p>MMAP appointments are on Mondays and Wednesdays and medications usually take 3-4 weeks to arrive.

      <h3>Pharmacotherapy</h3>
<p>Pharmacotherapy appointments are for patients seeking to improve control over their diabetes, blood pressure, and/or cholesterol. Pharmacists and students from the UGA College of Pharmacy meet regularly with patients to adjust medication, set goals and track progress towards those goals.</p>
